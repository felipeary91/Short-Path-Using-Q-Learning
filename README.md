# Short-Path-Using-Q-Learning
Reinforcement Learning is a trial and error application of ML, in which everytime the <br />
algorithm performs an action it gets rewarded. The overall obejective of the algorithm <br />
is to maximize the reward. It remembers the previously taken actions through two very <br />
important matrices: the R-Matrix and the Q-Matrix.
<br />
<br />
The R-Matrix maps the current state of the algorithm with the reward it will recibe for <br />
taking a determined action. On the other hand, the Q-Matrix is the "memory" of the algorithm <br />
and maps the rewards of the R-Matrix showing how to achieve the highest reward based on the <br />
previous states.
<br />
<br />
In this implementation, we will use the graph shown below to find the shortest path between <br />
two nodes. The user needs to enter both the initial and the final node.
